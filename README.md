# PixelFont
Font library for FastLED matrix displays.  Thanks to the FastLED developers (Daniel Garcia, Mark Kriegsman, and Jason Coon) for the awesome library!!

To use set your arduino sketchbook location to ".../PixelFont/arduino" and restart arduino.  Now open the "File->examples->pixel_font->ULTiM8x24Test" sketch at try it out.  This sketch is for a 8x24 array, modify the constants N_ROW and N_COL to suite your array.
